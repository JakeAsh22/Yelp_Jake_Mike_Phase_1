    "For over a centery, film, television & media production was ubiquitous in, and almost exclusive to, two major US metropolises: Los Angeles and New York. Over the past several decades, there have been many developments that have cracked this exclusivity: The advent of the internet has increased access to entertainment, while simultaneously inspiring a new generation of creators. Other advances in technology have allowed film-industry-standard production quality to be capable with devices that are commonplace with today's consumer. Further, state governments have begun competing to attract business with tax credits designed to lure productions to within their borders, where no production industry existed before. <br><br>\n",
    "With the help of business insights provided by the Yelp API, we will take a glimpse at this industry, comparing companies that offer production services in a few locations. Out goal is to find what business opportunities appear to be present within this industry, and ultimately, develop a business with what we find."

    "- **There are ~300 businesses in New York, just over 50 in Atlanta, and *at least* 1000 in Los Angeles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Without jumping to conclusions, both a saturated market and a barren one may have advantages and disadvantages for a startup business.\n",
    "   - A saturated market is very difficult to compete in, but we may be able to benefit by offering services that are *parallel* to businesses that are thriving there. E.g., we offer equipment rentals near a company that offers production services, or vice-versa. \n",
    "   - Additionally, were we to survive in the market to the point where we could scale, there are a multitude of other businesses close by that offer a variety of products or services that we may absorb to become a conglomerate. With there being such quantity and variety, we are more likely to find a company to buy that will fill in our needs precisely.\n",
    "   - A market with sparse industry is only easy to compete in if there is a demand for our services. If there is demand, we could quickly grow to become the pinnacle of industry in that locale. If there is none, we starve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The mean rating for film production businesses are highest in Los Angeles**.\n",
    "  - Popularity aside, the key takeaway here is that, on average, the film production businesses are more beloved in LA than in either NYC or Atlanta.\n",
    "    - It will be more difficult to get customers in this market, as customers here are already happy with what they have.\n",
    "- By contrast, the average rating for film production businesses in New York are only marginally higher than in Atlanta.\n",
    "  - NYC offers a larger market for film than Atlanta, while simultaneously having businesses that are negligibly more beloved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Review Count for businesses in New York have by far the highest standard deviation from the mean.**\n",
    "  - Were we to plot businesses in NYC on a map and look at their review counts, we would see that there is a large disparity between how frequented the most popular production businesses are from the least frequented, all over the city.\n",
    "  - Were we to open up shop in NYC, we *must* consider where we are opening business carefully! We could easily position ourselves next to a large production business that offers *different* services to ~~leech~~ develop a symbiotic relationship where their clients become our customers.\n",
    "  - Conversely, businesses that are less frequented could be in a comercial dead-zone (and we should stay away from that precise area), *or* could simply not be good at attracting customers (and we could easily outcompete)."
