# Yelp_Jake_Mike_Phase_1
Phase 1 Yelp project between peers Jake Ash and Mike Flanagan.

Hello! Thank you for visiting this repository!

This is an early-stage project with the goal to analyze business opportunities using data from the Yelp API.

Using this publicly available data, we hope to apply a bit of statistical analysis to see what sort of opportunities are present in several locales.

Ultimately, with insights attained from the data gathered with the Yelp API, we will compare opportunities between two locations. 

Please check back in sometime soon for a completed presentation. We will have a summary pitchbook available to download as a PDF within our reposity. 
And of course, if you are interested in any of the technical aspects of our project, feel free to check out any of our .ipynb and .py files.
We will do our best to keep non-technical explanations and our reasoning illustrated alongside our code. 

If you have any questions or inquiries, feel free to reach out to us via our github accounts!
